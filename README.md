"# Python_GridGame" 
Brain Buster - Memory Matching Game
A classic command-line memory matching game where players test their recall abilities by finding pairs of numbers on a customizable grid.
Features

Dynamic grid sizes (2x2, 4x4, or 6x6)
Multiple gameplay options:

Match two elements
Reveal single elements (with scoring penalty)
Practice mode with full grid reveal


Score tracking based on efficiency (minimum possible guesses vs. actual guesses)
Clear, intuitive command-line interface
Coordinate system using letters for columns and numbers for rows (e.g., A0, B1)

How to Play

Start the game by specifying the grid size:

bashCopypython3 game.py [2|4|6]

Choose from the following options:

Select two elements to find matches
Uncover one element (costs 2 guesses)
Reveal the entire grid
Start a new game
Exit


Enter coordinates using the letter-number format (e.g., A0, B1)

Scoring

Score is calculated based on efficiency: (minimum required guesses / actual guesses) Ã— 100
Revealing single elements costs double guesses
Perfect score requires completing the game in minimum possible moves
Using the "reveal grid" option ends the game without scoring
